#neuralnet
Replicating work of my youth in C ;) I think the first artificial neural network / evolution theory based learning combination I developed in C++, but not sure anymore.
Artifical neural network for test and learning purposes. Multi-layer perceptron. Evolution-theory and genetic algorithm based learning. Various activation functions to choose from.
